# ArtistWebsite

This is an artist website made for CST341. We are coding in Java and using the Spring Framework. 

This website is created by Almicke "Mickey" Navarro and Emily Quevedo. We are both currently juniors at Grand Canyon University. We are also Computer Programming majors. 

We are currently on Milestone 3. This Milestone requires us to demonstrate the use of the SpringBeans, Spring Core, and the Dependency Injection. Through that, we have created... 

  Model: User, Credentials, Event
  
  View: homePage, loginPage, registrationPage
  
  Controller: UserController, EventController

With the use of these pages, we have created these login, registration, and event creation modules.
